# Slash Contracts
Slash Contracts is a repository containing Ethereum smart contract code for managing and displaying information about contracts and their attestations. This project aims to provide a simple and transparent way to store and verify the authenticity and trustworthiness of smart contracts. It can be useful for developers, auditors, and users who want to ensure that the code they interact with is secure and reliable.

## Overview
The Slash Contracts system works by allowing users to add contracts to a registry along with relevant information. Attestors, who could be security experts or auditors, can then add attestations to the contracts, confirming their security and reliability. By accumulating attestations from multiple sources, the system creates a trust metric for each contract.

This process is beneficial for several reasons:

1. Increases trust in the smart contract ecosystem by providing a simple way to verify the security of contracts.
2. Helps developers showcase their secure and well-audited contracts to potential users.
3. Allows users to easily identify trustworthy contracts and avoid interacting with potentially harmful or insecure code.

## Who would want to use Slash Contracts
Slash Contracts can be useful for:

- Developers: who want to demonstrate the security and reliability of their smart contracts.
- Auditors and security experts: who want to provide attestations to contracts they have reviewed and confirmed as secure.
- Users: who want to ensure that the contracts they interact with are trustworthy and reliable.

## Running
This project uses the Foundry framework. Look at the package.json for the scripts.

## Frontend Repository
To display the contract information and interact with the contracts, an example PR was made https://github.com/alwaysbegrowing/arbor-frontend/pull/178.
